\subsection{System achitecture}\label{subsec:system-achitecture}
The System contains of three main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The web-client
    \item The browser-extension
    \item The server
\end{itemize}.

Together, the web-client and browser-extension act as the client in the server-client architecture and depend on the server.

The web client will be implemented as a single-page web-app written in angular.js, while the browser extension will be implemented in react.
The server will be based on Java-Spring.

\subsection{Interfaces}\label{subsec:interfaces}
External interfaces the system accesses are
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user-interfaces described in~\ref{sec:user-interface}
    \item The browser-interface to access html content rendered to the user
\end{itemize}.

Internally, following interfaces are provided:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A REST-interface provided by the server and used by the clients
    \item An interface that provides the html-files of the replics, provided by the server
    \item An SQL-Database that is used by the server.
\end{itemize}
